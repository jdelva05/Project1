# Hybrid and Adaptive Sorting Algorithms
Hybrid Algorithm

## Goals
1. Implementation
Create and put into use a hybrid sorting algorithm that combines insertion sort and quicksort. For sub-arrays that are larger than a threshold size, the algorithm employs quicksort; for sub-arrays that are smaller, it uses insertion sort.
