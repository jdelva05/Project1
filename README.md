# Hybrid and Adaptive Sorting Algorithms
Hybrid Algorithm

## Goals
1. Implementation
   
   Create and put into use a hybrid sorting algorithm that combines insertion sort and quicksort. For sub-arrays that are larger than a threshold size, the algorithm employs quicksort;    for sub-arrays that are smaller, it uses insertion sort.

2. Testing

   Use test cases to verify that the implemented hybrid sorting algorithm is correct.

3. Benchmarking

   Time Performance: For varying input sizes, compare the hybrid sorting algorithm's execution time to that of Python's built-in sorting algorithm,.sort().
   
   Memory Performance: Use the memory-profiler library to assess how much memory the hybrid sorting algorithm uses for various input sizes.
   
   Performance analysis: Examine the benchmarking experiment results to identify situations where the hybrid algorithm may perform better than the conventional sorting algorithm. The      execution time and memory usage metrics gathered during benchmarking will make this clear.
